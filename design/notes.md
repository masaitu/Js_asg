- `welcome_js`: Mobile-first landing screen showing the personalized greeting, quick onboarding copy, and the primary Run Estimator / Toggle Theme actions stacked for thumb reach. JavaScript updates the greeting text and binds the buttons on load.

- `summary_js`: Post-calculation state summarizing transport, snacks, total spend, and a 10% savings suggestion with a clear personalization line so staff can screenshot and reference the student later.
